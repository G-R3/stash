Stash

A CLI tool to help manage experimental files and directories

Stash is a CLI tool to manage test directories and files. I often find myself creating one-off files and directories for projects or when i'm learning something. Most recently I've been creating `test.js` files for interviews.

I want to create a tool to easily manage these files and directories

Features:
- can create new files/directories
    - prefix or subfix with the date it was created
- can search/filter files/directories
    - should have fuzzy searching
    - rds matches redis-server
    - connpool matches connection-pool
    - Recent stuff scores higher
    - Shorter names win on equal matches
- can delete files/directories (with confirmation)


Commands:
- `stash`: show the search/filtering UI with a list of all files and directories
    - if no files/directories exist, show the create UI
    - if the command is ran whilst in a deleted directory that is no longer found on /stash. The tool should `cd` us back into the root folder `/stash` to avoid any errors trying to list deleted files/folders 
- `stash create`: show the create UI where we can enter the name of file/directory
    - upon successful creation, `cd` into the directory
- stash <string>: shows the search/filtering UI with the <string> as the search query.
